# Scenario D

Hi, Dennis!

I hope everything is going well on your side. Were you able to receive our email or message in Slack? This is with regards to your class **CYB101** (Intro to Cybersecurity) coursework you havenâ€™t submitted.

Do you think there has been non-compliance to our policy? CodePath.org [course policies]( https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19) involves **punctuality and completeness of the coursework**. We only allow **two (2) absences** and there should be **no missed assignment**. If you think you have submitted within the timeframe given, feel free to communicate with us so we can work this out.

Once a student goes beyond the requirement on attendance and coursework submission, this means withdrawal from the class. However, your <mark>lifetime access</mark> to the course material will still prevail as long as you will **use your GitHub** that you used to sign up.

We will wait for your response.
