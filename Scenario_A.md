# Scenario A
## Hi, John!

Thank you for reaching out to us. We acknowledge your concern and we are happy to know about your MIT standings.

In [CodePath.org](https://www.codepath.org/), we want the best for our students which includes getting the best experience possible. The course structure of **Intermediate Web Development** will surely equip you with skills and knowledge that you will be needing for the **Advanced Wed Development** course. With this, we wonâ€™t be able to transfer you to advanced track.

We know that you will enjoy each coursework and your classes all throughout this semester.
We are looking forward to your completion of the intermediate track and to your registration for the advanced track!

If there is any clarification, feel free to contact us again.

All the best,

CodePath.org
